		<h2>rule of thumb</h2>
		<p>Tag what you see. In other words, only tag the visual and factual elements in the image. For example, images where the full moon is prominently depicted will have a full_moon tag. Ideally you should use an existing tag.
		<p>This means you should not tag what you know about a character. For example remilia_scarlet is supposed to be a vampire, but don't tag every picture depicting her with the vampire tag. Only use the vampire tag if the characteristics are clearly visible.</p>
		<p>Do not use subjective tags (such as sexy, cute, hot, etc). These tags are problematic because they are based on personal opinion, and different opinions can conflict.</p>
		<h2>series: character: and proper tagging format</h2>
		<p>Tag each picture with the general title of the show it is from using the series: tag. Crossovers deserve multiple series tags.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">series:kill la kill</p>
		<p>Tag each picture with each character it includes using the character: tag, one for each character. For japanese characters, this means <span style="font-weight:bold;">lastname firstname</span></p>
		<p style="text-align:center">character:matoi ryuko</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">character:kiryuin satsuki</p>
